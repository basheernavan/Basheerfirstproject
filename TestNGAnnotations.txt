Advantages of TestNG Annotations:
1. TestNG is also Java popular framework
2. This framework can be used by testers as well as developers
3. It is advanced version of Junit
4. Using this Testng we can decrease the length of the program code.
5. Comparing to JUnit it contains more annotations.
6. It can generate the temparary result as well as HTML reports.
7. Using TestNG annotations we can read the data from the flat file(any of the data file)
8. Using Testng we can do the parallel execution also.
9. Using testng we can do group execution also.

TestNG Annotations:
1. @Test: this method will execute the test case, test case execution enabled true.

2. @Test(enabled=false): This is ignore annoation, mean test case execution enabled false.

3. @BeforeMethod: This method will execute before execution of every method.

4. @AfterMethod: This method will execute after execution of every method.
				 Ex: if we have 5 tests, this method will execution 5 times.
				 
5. @BefreClass: This method will execute before execution of every class.

6. @AfterClass: This method will execute after execution of every class.
															---- upto this same as JUnit annotations.

7. @BeforeTest: This method will execute before Execution of every test
 
8. @AfterTest: This method will execute after execution of every test

9. @BeforeSuite: THis method will execute before execution of every suite.

10. @AfterSuite: This method will execute after execution of every suite.

11. @DataProvider: Using this annotation we can provide the data to the test case 
								and execute multiple times.
