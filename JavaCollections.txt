1. Differences between ArrayList and Array.
ArrayList:
1. There is no fixed length
2. Array List is a class
3. ArrayList We can add, Remove.



Array:
1. Fixed length
2. Array is a concept of Java.
3. We can't do add and Remove.


2. HashTable: Hash table also one of most important java collection,
this will work based on the key and value.
using the key we can get the value.

3. HashMap: Hashmap also one of the most important java collection,
it'll work similar to Hashtable, and we can create using the key and value pair.

=========================================================================================
What are the differences between HashMap and Hashtable?
HashMap: key and value pair.
1. HashMap is a non-synchronized. It is not-thread safe and can't be shared 
between many threads without proper synchronization code.
2. HashMap allow only one key and multiple null values.
3. HashMap is faster than Hashtable.
4. This HashMap implemented on as new class from JDK 1.2.
5. We can make HashMap as a synchronzed by calling this code 
Map m= Collections.synchronizedMap(HashMap);
6. HashMap is traversed by Iterator
7. HashMap inherits Abstractmap class. 


HashTable: key and value pair
1. Hashtable is synchronized. It is thread safe and can be shared with many threads.
2. It does not allow any null key and null values.
3. It is very slow.
4. Hashtable is a inbuilt or legacy class.
5. Hashtable is internally synchronized and can't required any code.
6. Hashtable is traversed by Enumerator and Iterator.
7. Hashtable inherits Dictionary class.
