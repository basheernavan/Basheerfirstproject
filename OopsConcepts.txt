Oops concepts:
1. Inharitance
2. Polimorphisam
3. Abstraction
4. Encapsulation

1. Inharitance: Java is a mechanisam one object acquires all the properties
 and bahaviours of a parent object.
 Parent class contains some methods and variables,
 these methods and variables we can use in the child class(using the extends.)
 
 public class A extends B{
 
 }
 
 B: is the Super class or parent class.
 A is the child class or subclass
 so, A class can use the methods and variables from B class.
 
 Inharitance is 3 types:
 1. Simple or single level inharitance
 2. Multi level inharitance
 3. Hiracle inharitance.
 
 1. Single Inharitance: extends one class to another class only.
 A --> B
 
 2. Multi level: A --> B --> C
 
 //Homework:
 Create ClassD, ClassE, ClassF
and create all the methods and variables as static then call without creating object.
 
 3. Hirarcle inharitance:
 X --> Y
 X --> Z
 
 ===================================================================================
 2. Polimorphisam:
 Polimorphisam is two types:
 1. Method overloading: Creating multiple methods on same name with different parameters
 is called method overloading.
 
 2. Method overriding: Creating one method in one class and overriding in another class
 is called method overriding.
 
 ====================================================================================
 3. Abstraction: abstraction mean only declaration of the methods or no body for methods.
 Abstract class mean we can create abstract methods and non-abstract methods 0-100% abstraction
 abstract methods we can impliment only in the classes. not in interfaces.
 abstract class and abstract methods create using the keyword abstract.
 
 Interface: we can create only abstract methods. 100% abstraction.
 
 
 Mobile:
 1. Calling
 2. Messaging
 3. Camera
 4. Videocalling
 5. Watsupmessage
 6. Music
 ============================================================================================
 4.Encapsulation: Encapsulation means binding the object state(fields) and behaviour(methods) together.
 mean hiding the implementation of the user details.
 in the encapsulation all the variables will declare as private.
 Encapsulation having or declaring Getter and Setter methods.
 
 
 ===========================================================================================
 5. Constructor: constructor is a special type of method in java.
 constructor is block of code that initialize the global variables.
 constructor will create using the class name.
 there is no return type for constructor.
 constructor will call or it'll be auto execute
 Constructor is mainly two types:
 1. Basic constructor 
 2. Parameter constructor
