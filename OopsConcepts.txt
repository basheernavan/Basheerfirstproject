Oops concepts:
1. Inharitance
2. Polimorphisam
3. Abstraction
4. Encapsulation

1. Inharitance: Java is a mechanisam one object acquires all the properties
 and bahaviours of a parent object.
 Parent class contains some methods and variables,
 these methods and variables we can use in the child class(using the extends.)
 
 public class A extends B{
 
 }
 
 B: is the Super class or parent class.
 A is the child class or subclass
 so, A class can use the methods and variables from B class.
 
 Inharitance is 3 types:
 1. Simple or single level inharitance
 2. Multi level inharitance
 3. Hiracle inharitance.
 
 1. Single Inharitance: extends one class to another class only.
 A --> B
 
 2. Multi level: A --> B --> C
 
 //Homework:
 Create ClassD, ClassE, ClassF
and create all the methods and variables as static then call without creating object.
 
 3. Hirarcle inharitance:
 X --> Y
 X --> Z

 2. Polimorphisam:
 Polimorphisam is two types:
 1. Method overloading: Creating multiple methods on same name with different parameters
 is called method overloading.
 
 2. Method overriding: Creating one method in one class and overriding in another class
 is called method overrriding.
