In webdriver we have 2 types of Synchronization functions.

1. Implicit wait:
 	1. Implicitly wait: 
 	2. Pageload timeout:
 Whenever we are using these implicit wait option, these functions will applicable
  to all the lines of code or it'll execute entire project.
  driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
  webdriver will wait until this maximum time(2 seconds) for each and every line of the code. 
  
  Pageload timeout: Webdriver will wait until each and every page to load until this maximum time.
  driver.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
  if the page is loaded with in 2seconds it won't wait for remaining 8 seconds.


2. Explicit wait: Webdriver will wait until this constant time and this 
	will applicable for that particular line
	1. Thread.sleep: this java based wait option.
	Ex: Thread.sleep(5000);
	
	2. WebdriverWait: Webdriver will wait until this maximum time and this
